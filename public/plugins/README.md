CKEditor WebSpellChecker Plugin
===============================

This plugin brings Web Spell Checker (WSC) into CKEditor.

WSC is "installation-less", using the web-services of [WebSpellChecker.net](http://www.webspellchecker.net/). It's an out of the box solution.

Installation
------------

1. Clone/copy this repository contents in a new "plugins/wsc" folder in your CKEditor installation.
2. Enable the "wsc" plugin in the CKEditor configuration file (config.js):

        config.extraPlugins = 'wsc';

That's all. WSC will appear on the editor toolbar and will be ready to use.
